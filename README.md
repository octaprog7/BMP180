# BMP180
Micropython module for BMP180 pressure&amp temperature sensor.

Just connect your BMP180 board to Arduino, ESP or any other board with MicroPython firmware.

Supply voltage BMP180 3.3 Volts! Not 5 volts! Use four wires to connect.
1. +3.3 V
2. GND
3. SDA
4. SCL

Upload micropython firmware to the NANO(ESP, etc) board, and then two files: main.py and bmp180.py. 
Then open main.py in your IDE and run it.
